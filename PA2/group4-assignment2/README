COMPLETE:
All problems are complete.

COMPILATION & EXECUTION:
.py files can be run by: $ python <file name>.py
.cpp files can be compiled using: $ g++ <file name>.cpp -o <file name>
then run using: $ ./<file name>
See make file for additional information. 
Run $ make problem<prob #> to build and run the problem.
Just make compiles and runs all problems.

TEST CASES:
All test case information is either included in the source or part of the program output.
See program output descriptions below.

PROGRAM OUTPUT:
Problem 1: Codes for all the characters in the tree.
Problem 2: Best numerical constants for deletion and insertion.
Problem 5: Size of the generated trie from AliceInWonderland.txt
Problem 6: Outputs the final Dijkstra's algorithm table.
Problem 7: Outputs each step of the algorithm as it eliminates the smallest value, and updates the set of nodes incorporated into the algorithm.
Problem 8: Outputs the final Floyd's algorithm table.
Problem 9: Depth-first search algorithm for fig. 6.38 p.226
Problem 10: Outputs the example data set, the computed FFT, and the MATLAB computed FFT for the same data set.
